# Oru Phones - Flutter Application

Oru Phones is a robust Flutter application that offers an optimal and interactive user experience. It is equipped with various features such as providers for HTTP requests, value-notifiers for UI updates, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications, singleton classes, infinite scroll for products, product filters, and reusable widgets for enhanced efficiency.

## Features

- **Providers for HTTP requests**: This application utilizes the Provider package for state management, allowing for GET and POST HTTP requests. 

- **ValueNotifier**: Instead of using setState, we leverage ValueNotifier to update the UI, enhancing efficiency and responsiveness.

- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: With FCM, the application offers real-time push notifications, improving user experience and engagement.

- **Singleton Class**: Singleton design pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it, promoting optimal resource utilization.

- **Infinite Scroll and Product Filters**: The application features an infinite scroll for products, creating a seamless browsing experience. Additionally, users can filter products to fine-tune their browsing.

- **Reusable Widgets**: To reduce code redundancy and simplify development, reusable widgets are used throughout the application.
